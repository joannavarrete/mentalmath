Mentalmath
=========

Silly project to practice my mental math skills and also practice a bit of clisp.

To practise just call the function (practise types) with the type of practice you want, if you pass more than one you'll get a random type every time.

The types are 

* sum-two-by-two 
* sum-three-by-three 
* sub-two-by-two 
* sub-three-by-three 
* mult-two-by-one
